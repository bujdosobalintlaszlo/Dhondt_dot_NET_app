# Dhondt .NET app
#Projects goal
In school we needed to implemet a system from the real world which involved a system with visualizable data. So we chose D’Hondt which is tied to the Europian parlament. Previously we wrote a console app for this
so this task wasn't just about problemsolving but refactoring too. Fortunatelly we took this task with ease and got a 100% for our project.

# How did we mannaged to compelte the task?
When we wrote this application, we have already been a team before with my teammate. We both know what eachothres stregth and weaknesses so, it was much easier to navigate trough struggles. For communication we use discord and a shared google drive, where we had an excel sheet. With that we were able to track our tasks and deadlines.

# Features of the app:
- The app was mainly written to bigger screens with 16:9,16:10 aspect ratios, since there wasn't any restrictions regading that and the used platform (forms) wasn't really suted for that.
