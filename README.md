# Dhondt .NET app
#Projects goal
In school we needed to implemet a system from the real world which involved a system with visualizable data. So we chose D’Hondt which is tied to the Europian parlament. Previously we wrote a console app for this
so this task wasn't just about problemsolving but refactoring too. Fortunatelly we took this task with ease and got a 100% for our project.

# How did we mannaged to compelte the task?
When we developed this application, we had already worked as a team before.
We knew each other’s strengths and weaknesses, which made collaboration and problem-solving much easier.
For communication, we used Discord, and for task tracking, a shared Google Drive spreadsheet.
This allowed us to organize tasks, monitor deadlines, and stay on track efficiently.

# Features of the app:
(The app was mainly written to bigger screens with 16:9,16:10 aspect ratios, since there wasn't any restrictions regading that and the used platform (forms) wasn't really suted for that. Also the application is in my native language.)
